# Project: aartics_portfolio


For my design portfolio (<a href="http://www.aartics.com" target="_blank">aartics.com</a>), I undertook making a 3D representation of a gallery of my projects, viewed as if in a VR world.

# Part 1: Spatial Visualizations - Imagining new media futures.

### Visualizing a three dimensional gallery:

I started with a grid of hexagons where each hexagon could represent a project, an image or other data. By using a hexagonal grid, I will be able to allow the viewer to extend explorations in 6 directions, instead of the traditional 4.

### Visualizing a spherical gallery:

Conceptually, using a hexagonal grid could also allow ‘folding’ the design pattern into spherical geodesic dome "worlds of information" that viewers could choose to explore. That could be fun.

### Visualizing a panoramic gallery:

This enabled me to imagine viewers experiencing equally sized hexagonal tiles in a panoramic dome, and not restricted to traditional rectangular view-boxes (like this web browser we are reading this article on). Viewing from inside the dome (panorama) seemed to limit a user’s view, so I chose to explore viewing from the outside (inverse panorama).

### Visualizing data in 3D:

I could then use extruded projections for information of various types and hierarchies - qualitative or quantitative data. These can be represented as heights of the polygons.

### Visualizing bird's eye perspective:

I proceeded to visualize the panoramic bird’s eye view interface for my website, by working on achieving the right perspective for viewing on a desktop browser.

# Part 2: Recipe - How to make a 3D perspective interaction experience in a desktop browser:

### Ingredients: SketchUP Make, Adobe PhotoShop + Illustrator, HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery library and jInvertScroll plugin).

#### 1. Drawing the objects in perspective location and shadows:

I made the 3D object representation in SketchUP Make. For the current design, this is a hexagonal column grid.

I exported screenshots of the “bird’s eye view” camera perspective of the model:

I stitched the screenshots in PhotoShop for a continuous panoramic effect. I used 20 states of full length images to understand the effect. These images served as the wireframes for the site.

I used the 20 state images in html with the jInvertScroll library to change the image based on the position of the cursor on the page.

### Concept wireframes:

#### 2. Converting the shapes and shadows from the panoramic shots to vector graphics:

What I describe here is a very tedious way to achieve the vector conversion, and I am currently looking for better ways to export the 3D model directly to SVGs. Meanwhile, here is the description of what I did.

I laid out 9 states of the 3D panorama in Adobe Illustrator on individual artboards and illustrated the shapes and shadows as polygons for every state. Care was taken to ensure that each artboard contains the same layer name for individual polygons.

I then exported all the artboards as individual SVGs from Illustrator.

#### 3. Scripting magic: Morphing svg polygons in browser based on user interaction

Studying the structure of the SVG shows that each polygon is stored with a “points” attribute which is an array of numbers and each state of the panorama is a different set of numbers.

With the help of my friend, philosopher and programmer extraordinaire guide @owings1, we wrote a script that will store the points value for each polygon as arrays objects in JSON.

We then used vanilla JavaScript to update the values of the points attribute for each polygon in an initialized SVG based on the position of the cursor on the page. To achieve the horizontal panning effect on the page, we used the jInvertScroll library to retrieve the cursor position value, but this is not needed.

#### Concept for gallery browser in VR/MR/AR:

------------------

Thanks to this design exercise, we now have an animation framework to morph Illustrator graphics to interactive HTML. 
This allows us to imagine and prototype 3D visual interactions in 2D tools and traditional browsers. There are many improvements to be made, and as time goes on, I hope to present more examples and improved versions of this framework.


#### References on Hexagonal Grids
I continue to study the applications of using hexagonal grids. This is one of the best references I have found:
